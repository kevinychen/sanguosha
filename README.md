## How to use

This app allows players to perform all the possible actions in the base set and supported expansions, but does not enforce rules other than tracking turn order and end-of-turn discards. The goal is to make it possible to easily play the game online with friends.

To draw a card from the deck, click the deck or press 'C'. (Click the "hotkeys" button on the left to see all hotkeys.)

To play a card from hand normally, click on it or press the number corresponding to its position in your hand. The action will depend on the card; for example, equipment will be played on your character card, delay tool cards will prompt you to select a player to play it on, and most other cards will be sent to the discard pile in the middle of the screen. If you wish to send an equipment or delay tool card directly to the discard, then click "Dismantle" before selecting the card.

The buttons on the left allow you to perform other actions, such as Giving one of your cards to another player, Dismantling/Stealing another card, Revealing one of your cards to another player, Flipping a card/character card, performing a Judgment, displaying N cards for a Harvest, or passing the Lightning card to the next player.

To increase or decrease your health, click on the large health icons on your character card. If your health reaches 0, you reach "Brink of Death" and the game will prompt for whether you die. You can also toggle your chain status by clicking on the semi-transparent chain icon on your character card.

Finally, some characters have special abilities that might not be possible to perform with the above actions. In these cases, there will be a special button on the left. For example, Zhuge Liang can click "Astrology" to view N cards, put some on top of the deck, and send the remaining to the bottom of the deck.

To view English descriptions, click "Help" and then a card or character card to get its description.
